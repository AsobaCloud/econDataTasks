# Econ Data Tasks

This is a growing library of helper tools for ingesting datasets from popular financial/economic sources via API

## Sources

- US Census
- Federal Research Economic Data (FRED)
- Quandl (will add next)

## Getting started

Request an API key from census.gov to access the census API (https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html).  Once you have your key, add CENSUS_KEY = <your key> to your .Renviron
  
Next, get your FRED API key to access Federal Research Economic Data API calls (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html).  Once you have your key, add FRED_KEY = <your key> to your .Renviron
